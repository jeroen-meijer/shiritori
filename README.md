# Shiritori - Flutter App

The Japanese game Shiritori for iOS, Android and web.

Work in progress, does not work yet.

## Highlights

- Well-composed modern UI.
- Context-aware theming.
- Full Intl localization.
- Custom animations.

## TODO

Here are some things I still need/want to implement.

- Actually being able to play the game.
- Backend integration to play against other players preferably using Firebase.
- More pretty animations.

### Credits

As an exercise, I tried to copy this [beautiful UI mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/5836646-Quiz-iOS-app-Animation) done by [Mike from Creative Mints](https://dribbble.com/creativemints). Give 'em some love.
