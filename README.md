# Shiritori - Flutter App

The Japanese game Shiritori for iOS, Android and web.

**Proof of concept and work in progress -- does not work yet.**

## Highlights

- Well-composed [modern UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/5836646-Quiz-iOS-app-Animation).
- Context-aware theming.
- Full Intl localization.
- Custom animations.

# How to launch

The client can be found in the `app/` directory.
Either open this project in your editor and run it through your
IDE, or go to the `app/` folder and run the app manually.

```bash
cd app/
flutter run
```

A dictionary parser can be found in the `/dict_parser` directory.
It currently only supports parsing the Japanese `JMdict_e` document,
but can be refactored to support more languages and formats relatively easily.

A script is included that compiles the parser to native and then runs it against
the included `JMdict_e.xml` file.

**Warning: the `JMdict_e.xml` file is extremely large (~30M lines).**
**Opening it in an editor may make your text editor lag or crash altogether.**

Run the dict_parser by using the included script:
```bash
./scripts/run_dict_parser.sh
```

# TODO

Here are some things I still need/want to implement.

- Actually being able to play the game.
- Backend integration to play against other players preferably using Firebase.
- More pretty animations.
